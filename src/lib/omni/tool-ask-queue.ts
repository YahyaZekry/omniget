/**
 * The pet's queue of pending tool permissions (`GrantMode::Ask`).
 *
 * `llm://tool-ask` (the re-emitted `BusEvent::ToolAsk`) reaches every window,
 * the pet included. The pet may therefore hold several questions at once — a
 * turn can ask twice before the user looks at the screen — so they are kept in
 * a FIFO queue and the head is the one the bubble offers.
 *
 * Everything here is pure: no Tauri, no DOM, no clock, no timers. The window
 * owns the clock and the `invoke`; this file only decides what the queue looks
 * like after an event, which is the part a test can reach.
 *
 * What the pet is allowed to show is deliberately narrow: the *name* of the
 * tool and nothing else. The arguments of a call routinely carry paths, URLs,
 * prompts and secrets, and the pet is a window that sits on top of everything
 * the user may be screen-sharing. `sanitizeAsk` drops every field that is not
 * part of the four-string contract, so a payload that grew an `input` cannot
 * leak through the bubble by accident.
