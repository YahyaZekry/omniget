//! `WorldManager`: the one tick thread, the sleep states and the binary
//! channel. Owned by f7-world-bridge.
//!
//! Lazy on purpose. `AppState.world` is a `OnceLock` that stays empty until
//! somebody opens `/world`, and even a `WorldManager` that exists has no thread
//! until [`WorldManager::open`] is called: the budget line "app that never
//! opens `/world` = 0 ms CPU, 0 thread" (plan §1.2) is enforced by there being
//! nothing to run, not by a flag that something checks.
//!
//! One thread, named `omniget-world-tick`, drives everything:
//!
//! ```text
//!   lock ─ drain the bus ─ step()/catch_up() ─ diff_since() ─ encode ─ outbox
//!        └ unlock ─ send on the Channel ─ lock ─ wait(interval or forever)
//! ```
//!
//! The send happens with the lock released, and the outbox is bounded, so a
//! webview that stops draining the channel can never slow the simulation down;
//! it loses the oldest frames and gets a fresh snapshot instead of a diff with
//! a hole in it (see [`crate::commands::world::tick::Outbox`]).
//!
//! Nothing in here reads a clock the simulation can see: `World` is a pure
//! function of seed, map and inputs, and the wall clock only ever decides *when*
//! a tick happens and how much time `catch_up` has to skip.
